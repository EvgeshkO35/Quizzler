iOS App Design Pattern(MVC) and Code Structuring

## My Goal

The goal of this tutorial is to take one step further in my journey of becoming an app developer. I am going to introduce you to the holy grail of mobile design patterns: the Model View Controller (MVC) pattern. A design pattern is simply a repeatable and optimised solution to a common software problem and you’ll learn more about this when use in the tutorial.

## What I created 

I will program a trivia quiz app. If you have another field of expertise such as law or medicine, you’ll be glad to know that multiple choice question apps are one of the most popular types of educational apps on the App Store!

## What I learned from this module 

* How to programmatically change UI elements such as Labels and Buttons.
* What is a design pattern and how is it used in programming.
* How to use the Model-View-Controller or MVC pattern for app development.
* Learn about Swift Structures how to instantiate a struct instance.
* Understand the difference between value types and reference types. 
* Learn about Swift Classes and creating Objects.
* Compare Swift Classes with Swift Structs and know when to use which.
* Learn about Object Oriented Programming.
* How to refactor code and stay organised.
